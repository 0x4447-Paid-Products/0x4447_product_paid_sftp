We created this CloudFormation file to allow an easy and automated deployment process of our [custom Samba AMI product](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B084HF14KL?ref=_ptnr_social_github) - available in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=80edcebf-11fb-4c36-a3f4-49eb40b518a3&ref=_ptnr_social_github). 

You can find the full documentation of how to use our product here: [documentation.0x4447.com](https://documentation.0x4447.com/products/cloud/aws-marketplace/xxx-server.html).

# Feature of the stack

Once deployed the stack will create a EC2 instance automatically for you, with a special alarm to automatically recover if there was a AWS Hardware failure. Meaning the OpenVPN server will always be available. Also by default the Instance have termination protection ON.

**IMPORTANT**: all the unique server configuration is stored in the EFS drive. Meaning if you use the same EFS ID in the UserData section - the server will work exactly how you left it.

# Pricing

Once the stack is deployed you will pay for the AWS resources created in your account, plus you will get charged monthly for the 0x4447 OpenVPN custom AMI, the price willvarry based o the instance type hat you'll select when deploying the stack. Check the [product page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07YN9CCV4/) to find out about the pricing options.

# How to generate the CloudFormation file

This repo was build using the [Grapes Frameworks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x4447/grapes). To create a CF file locally, first you need to install the framework:

```
sudo npm install -g @0x4447/grapes
```

Then go inside this repo and run this command

```
grapes -s .
```

This will create a `CloudFormation.json` file in the root dir of the repo.
